target = "thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf"

# This is the hard-float ABI for Arm mode.

# The FPU is enabled by default, and float function arguments use FPU
# registers.

# Pass some extra options to rustc, some of which get passed on to the linker.
#
# * linker argument --nmagic turns off page alignment of sections (which saves
#   flash space)
# * linker argument -Tlink.x tells the linker to use link.x as a linker script.
#   This is usually provided by the cortex-m-rt crate, and by default the
#   version in that crate will include a file called `memory.x` which describes
#   the particular memory layout for your specific chip. 
# * linker argument -Tdefmt.x also tells the linker to use `defmt.x` as a
#   secondary linker script. This is required to make defmt_rtt work.
